# DSA Coding Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my **DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) Coding Journey** repository! This repository is a collection of coding problems, solutions, and notes that Iâ€™ve gathered while learning and practicing DSA. Itâ€™s a work in progress and a log of my improvement as I dive deeper into algorithms and data structures.

## Overview

This repository tracks my progress and solutions to various DSA problems, covering a range of topics like sorting, searching, dynamic programming, and more. Whether you are preparing for coding interviews or sharpening your problem-solving skills, youâ€™ll find a variety of solved problems categorized by data structures and algorithms.

## Problem Categories

The problems are organized into the following categories:

- **Arrays & Strings**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Stacks & Queues**
- **Trees & Graphs**
- **Recursion & Backtracking**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Sorting & Searching**
- **Hashing**
  
Each category contains various coding challenges, with detailed explanations and optimized solutions where applicable.

## Languages Used

The solutions are primarily written in:
- **Python**
- **Java**

More languages may be added over time as I continue to explore different approaches to solving DSA problems.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
